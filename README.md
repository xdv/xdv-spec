# XDV Specification Corpus  
## Cross-Domain Virtualizer (K / Q / Φ Native Operating System)

**Organization:** Dust LLC  
**Project:** XDV — Cross-Domain Virtualizer  
**Corpus Version:** 0.1-draft  
**Status:** Foundational Specification Development

# Overview

The XDV Specification Corpus defines the complete architectural, mathematical, operational, and security foundations of XDV — a K/Q/Φ-native operating system designed to virtualize and coordinate multiple computational substrates within a unified deterministic control plane.

XDV is not an extension of legacy operating systems.

It is a formal redefinition of the operating system for hybrid compute systems.

# Core Definition

> **XDV — Cross-Domain Virtualizer**  
> A K-domain (classical), Q-domain (quantum), and Φ-domain (phase-native) operating system that virtualizes and coordinates multiple computational substrates into a unified deterministic execution environment.

---

# Design Doctrine

XDV is built upon five non-negotiable principles:

1. **Domain Equivalence**  
   K, Q, and Φ are first-class computational domains.

2. **Deterministic Orchestration**  
   The global control plane remains deterministic, even when managing probabilistic or coherence-sensitive substrates.

3. **Virtualization over Emulation**  
   XDV virtualizes computational domains instead of emulating foreign paradigms.

4. **Zero-Trust Domain Boundaries**  
   All cross-domain interaction is capability-scoped and policy-verified.

5. **Φ-Native Compatibility**  
   The architecture explicitly supports coherent phase-structured computation.

# Domain Model (K / Q / Φ)

XDV formalizes three computational domains:

## K-Domain
Deterministic classical execution.
- Threaded computation
- Persistent memory
- System control plane
- Stable state authority

## Q-Domain
Probabilistic quantum computation.
- Logical qubit abstraction
- Measurement-bound result extraction
- Decoherence constraints
- Error correction models

## Φ-Domain
Coherent phase-native computation.
- Structured phase evolution
- Interference-based transformation
- Coherence-window constraints
- Deterministic or structured semantics (architecture dependent)

Each domain is abstracted as a schedulable substrate.

# Specification Numbering Scheme

Each specification document follows the pattern:

XDV-XXX — Title

Where:

- 000–009: Foundational axioms  
- 010–019: Kernel core  
- 020–029: Execution layer  
- 030–039: Security  
- 040–049: Networking  
- 050–059: DPL integration  
- 060–069: Hardware interfaces  
- 070–079: Observability  
- 080–099: Reference implementation  

Future expansions may introduce additional volumes.

# Normative Language

The following terms are used as defined in RFC-style standards:

- MUST  
- MUST NOT  
- REQUIRED  
- SHALL  
- SHALL NOT  
- SHOULD  
- SHOULD NOT  
- MAY  

All normative requirements will be explicitly marked.

# Development Phases

Phase 1 — Architectural Formalization  
Phase 2 — Kernel Prototype (DPL)  
Phase 3 — Cross-Domain Runtime Integration

# Intended Audience

This corpus is intended for:

- Systems architects  
- Kernel engineers  
- Quantum runtime engineers  
- Φ-domain researchers  
- Formal methods engineers  
- Hybrid infrastructure developers  

---

# Status

This corpus is in draft stage.

Interfaces, invariants, and domain semantics may evolve during formalization.

Backward compatibility is not guaranteed prior to 1.0 specification freeze.

---

# Closing Statement

XDV does not extend classical operating systems.

It formalizes a multi-domain computational reality.

K, Q, and Φ are peers.

The operating system is the deterministic boundary between them.

XDV virtualizes computation itself.
